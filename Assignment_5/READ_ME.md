# Transfer Learning for image data using CNN
- Dataset: 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens
- Fine-tuned a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG-19) to classify duck vs chicken and output the classification report

# Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer
- sentiment analysis dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset
- Built a sentiment analysis classifier to classify the sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model
