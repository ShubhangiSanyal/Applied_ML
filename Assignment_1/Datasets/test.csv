 03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new  big blue ?  by mike jude and nancy meachim  the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three -  letter acronyms .  remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized  computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications  that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure ,  especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with  computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to  maintain .  of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity .  and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a  bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell ,  so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into  intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the  glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion .  looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder  how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off .  thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized  computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application  management .  the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server  advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning  software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but  asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed  programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the  principle remains the same : central control makes support much more  efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ?  to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old  centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support  an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary  network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network  service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if  the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an  hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow .  nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a  minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the  world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop .  however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s  to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in  an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down  at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start  working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing !  so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s  problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what  happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became  the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks  couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers .  to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo  service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many  choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s  one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose  any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these  days .  to contact mike jude and nancy meachim :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are  with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . ,  ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market  research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise  management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the  telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a  manager of public policy . mike can be reached at  mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business  management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp  management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address  is mailto : meachim @ . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99  asp research page , network world  all about asps  information center for application service providers , their customers  and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp  industry consortium .  http : / / www . aspindustry . org /  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _",Ham

214,"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",Ham

"" the 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent  rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .  crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment  banker .  he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were  included in our december 1999 and may 2000  surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in december . it  also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .  the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p  expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent  earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,  227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent  versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  december . higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""  crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :  apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .  ( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .  ( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and  development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :  sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and  titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned  u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett  resources corp .

( nyse :  hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp .

( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum  corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .  ( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal  dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .

"" compared with  december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc .

( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian  petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .  counterparts , producers above the border raised  their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow , according to the lehman analyst .  he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well  above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them . ""  overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned .  he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets , including  texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf  s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and  amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized  companies .  crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during  2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25  per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what  lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30  per mcf of gas ) .

( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .  factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for  reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time .  the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not  optimal . hence  ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most  accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different  inputs .  ( 2 ) the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way ,  however , if you believe that positions are not captured correctly , please let  our it staff know that .  ( 3 ) checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in .  however , as you know , there could be disconnects with enpower , etc .  in any event , it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run  out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis .  your help is appreciated .  regards  naveen",Ham

369,"Subject: update - reimbursement of individually billed items  the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few  years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase  in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have  reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle .  although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual  employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times  they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these  cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we  try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of  employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this  increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less  productive than paying invoices .  to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary  for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and  other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay  for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions  are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through  employee expense reports .  by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce  the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of  checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the  turnaround time for payment of invoices .  incidentally , accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide  web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has  used for the past year . this will make it even easier to file your expense  report and receive quick reimbursement .  we  , d like to make this effective immediately . if you have any questions or  suggestions , please contact the accounts payable department .",Ham

381,"Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don ' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383",Ham

422,"Subject: status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",Ham

475,"Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01  executive summary  ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .  ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :  puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value  ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing  utility .  ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some  details :  of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this  summer  some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months  none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot  market  ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly  announce a 10 % rate hike .  ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .  pg & e  transmissions deal  one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power  contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e  officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now .  pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to  relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of  last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings .  but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s  concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things  get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then  pg & e will be left holding the bag .  thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is  demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of  jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative  demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must  "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .  the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they  think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for  davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but  not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative .  remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will  be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution .  on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives  the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads .  ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 %  above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done ,  anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through  the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .  ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion  loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .  ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving .  thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior  political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they  come up with something even more outrageous . ""  pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good  for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .  davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year  while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts  for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will  accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires .  that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .  ferc  the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal  energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that  ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but  they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs  off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what  anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three  possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is  opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that  davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .  one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman  curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not  be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other  appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and  one of them "" could easily become chairman .

"" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is  most likely to be a  technical failure , but we will investigate why it  happened , "" suresh prabhu ,  the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust  of india .  india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big  problem . thirty per  cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according  to analysts . in new  delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .  two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours .  assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s  inefficient power  sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further .

"" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india  general manager  of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat  to china light &  power of hong kong .  india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity  must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since  1992 , ipps have  added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under  construction . this is  insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic  growth .  enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,  winning fast - track project  approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a  dollars 1 . 87 bn plant  of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas ( lng ) ,  will be completed this year . only two of seven other  fast - track proposals  have achieved financial closure .  from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating  in maharashtra ' s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister  of the successor  government , says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable .  enron , whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists , wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment . enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,  such as energy , gas  and bandwidth .  to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed  this year . it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas . and it is  laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity .  in any event , enron believes it has a watertight  contract . it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and  industrial hub , as an  unreliable destination for investment .  mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor , which  threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options  are limited .  scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders .  maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility  and enron ' s main  client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent  of dabhol ' s output . yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take  has averaged 60  per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power .  one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the  tariff would be  rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but  with off - take a  third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and  often higher . in  october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take  was about 49 per  cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,  run on cheaper  lng , starts .  these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a 30 per  cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer .  enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,  which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power .  reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as  transmission and  distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and  technical losses , is  overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be  better spent on t & d  rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,  managing director of n m  rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network .  for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to  satisfy the  competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay  bhatnagar , chief  executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade  magazine , one of the  key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility  to deal with  externalities "" .  copyright : the financial times limited  , copyright the financial times limited 2000 .

""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . ""  "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply .  "" i don ' t know what to do . ""  "" go outside and find a friend . ""  "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ""  "" use your imagination . ""  "" huh ? "" he asked .  "" well , when i was young . . . "" you know the routine .  sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching  someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be  better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available  to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will  pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard  of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large  cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants .  i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence  to have fun ?  i think i ' ll go climb a tree .  maybe there ' s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is  attacking my castle .  just imagine .  - - michael t . smith  michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son .  from our mailbag :  ( in response to last week ' s story , cinderella men )  dear heartwarmers :  last week ' s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane . i  too , was born in the 30 s and felt some of the poverty of that time .  i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that  was so ever present in their lives . we were very fortunate in as  much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter . we had a  garden and salvaged every edible product available - - even certain  "" weeds "" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in  them . i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i  wore with pride ! we were very poor , but so rich indeed because we  had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives , and  it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books . i  deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught  me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of  prosperity and promise . thank you again for your lovely story . god  bless .  - -  do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

"" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""  he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""  2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough  angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .  3 . new generator construction  anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

691,"Subject: vince and vasant :  here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at  the east desk , related to gas transmission :  typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example  might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay  $ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed  payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for  overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is  $ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .  as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .  also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum  ( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of  "" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and  brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take  ( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,  in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .  clayton",Ham

694,"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",Ham

711,"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",Ham

 i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail  the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples  from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",Ham

715,"Subject: managing enron ' s relationships with the universities  jeff ,  i would like to get on your calendar ( together with jeff shankman ) for 15 -  30 minutes  to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze .  a separate message about this visit will follow .  i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships  with  different universities . historically , we were rather passive customers of  the academic institutions , trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence  on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions .  we should rethink the way we work with universities . the efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand - to - hand combat and often we  are not  very successful . it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses  and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways :  1 . involvement in research projects . for example , we are currently  underwriting two research  projects at stanford university , involving ph . d . students of professor  nicholas bambos  ( a top expert on communications networks ) . we shall participate in formulation  of the projects ' objectives and will be given access to the results .  involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock - up some very  promising students . most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs .  2 . lectures and presentations by enron employees . practically every  presentation  i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions .  it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic  program . in many cases ,  the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years .  3 . visits by faculty members in enron .  closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students  and obtaining access to current research . the universities are very important  in shaping public opinion  on the issues critical to enron ' s future ( especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets ) .  currently , the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number  of overworked enron employees . in many cases , there is no continuity and  focus .  i want to recommend a creation of a special function ( vp or md level )  responsible for coordinating  our relationships with the universities . this function would be separate from  our analyst / associate  program . i have many ideas how this function could be structured .  vince",Ham

( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . )  in morning of the first day , researchers from universities  presented their project proposals . i found some of them  quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado ,  tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset  valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric  power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not .  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion .  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants .  the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems  to me ) ,  each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were  accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" ,  which i found quite amusing ) .  all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also ,  the communication among university researchers , between stem committee  and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry ,  are not smooth as all .  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right ""  projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on  this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive .  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is  $ 40 , 000  per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway .  alex",Ham

772,"Subject: the storage revolution has begun  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun  03 / 07 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the storage revolution has  begun  by amy larsen decarlo  believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution .  virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to  terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is  skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to  rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of  storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery .  it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that  are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies  place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound  effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant  storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their  employees , suppliers and customers .  but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average ,  double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months ,  companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the  proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for  the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ?  the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed  storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in  advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support  those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not  from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those  systems .  there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best  routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing  storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file  servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when  enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a  progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing  the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it  does with the physical location of the files .  next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally  important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary  by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make  storage implementation decisions based on business needs .  businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for  alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to  speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and  recovery operations from the lan .  network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one  answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to  stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years ,  are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better  performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network .  instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross -  platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments .  many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term  answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are  designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they  alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated  with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment  stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still  largely untested in a production environment .  this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management ,  it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery  to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the  least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will  look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging  technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues .  ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and  practices that work in real - world environments .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates  in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading  analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of  enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application  management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research  and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas .  prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise  management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and  data communications . she can be reached at  mailto : decarlo @ . com  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  the national storage industry consortium ( nsic )  http : / / www . nsic . org  the distributed management task force ( dmtf )  http : / / www . dmtf . org  storage systems standards working group of the ieee  http : / / www . ssswg . org  the ietf  http : / / www . ietf . org  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

785,"Subject: re : working gas price model  vince -  i have a simplified version of brad ' s model in mind .  the "" no arbitrage "" condition equates trading margins across the country .  costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network . wellhead supply is  almost completely price - elastic , while burner - tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic . storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option .  the least time - variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline , followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline . the intermediate - variant parameters are  the capacity - dependent costs paid to the pipeline ( above shrinkage ) for  transmission . the most time - variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option .  there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork .  they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways : using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above , or point - estimates ( "" calibrations "" ) using only today ' s data  based on a node - based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination , albeit markedly different terminus , price  versus capacity similarly , "" competing "" for outflows .  i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience .  clayton",Ham

810,"Subject: preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",Ham

823,"Subject: hurricane warning derivatives  folks ,  this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress  toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line  of products .  it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane  warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative  products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this  exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural  counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure :  pro - hurricane anti - hurricane  the weather channel resorts  home depot cruise ships  lowes riverboat casinos  cnn chemical plants and refineries  local tv stations u . s armed forces  dry ice manufacturers athletic teams  chainsaw manufacturers city governments  insect repellant manufacturers state governments  it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is  important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature  while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have  documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the  thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional  products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in  bundled regional products depending on their exposure .  thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data  from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by  year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning  duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary  data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s  coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly  similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north  carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida  panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas .  while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it  has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration  is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility ,  when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to  effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning  frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be  well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly  probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves .  as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be  scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends ,  satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go  further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline .  on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the  weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given  our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the  easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when  we should approach customers .  please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project .  thanks ,  charlie",Ham

( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",Ham

952,"Subject: re : status  clayton ,  we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday .  regarding the trip to portland . such a trip requires an explicit prior  permission from your boss ,  myself in his absence , or stinson in my and vasant ' s absence .  in case you did not ask for such a permission before , the request is denied .  vince  clayton vernon @ enron  07 / 20 / 2000 03 : 12 pm  to : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",Ham

1106,"Subject: update : ffvols  ted ,  an update on the implementation for ffvols :  ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations  ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var  calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the  implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong  winter prices .  ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the  historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders  will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm  and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 .  ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology  ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio  of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some  implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio  indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the  historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems  appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical  numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied .  ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and  if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production  methodology .  of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different  indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a  sensible compromise of the different methods .  regards  naveen",Ham
