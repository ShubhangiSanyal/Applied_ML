3,"Subject: access on the block : international transmission auctions - cera a  lert - december 20 , 2000  title : access on the block : international transmission auctions are opening  european power markets  e - mail category : cera insight  cera knowledge area : european power  despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission  system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence ,  auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united  kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the  netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single european marketplace .  however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming ,  third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand ,  these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme .  nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe ' s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 .  international auctions are opening markets  a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera ' s view auctions for  itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas :  * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market ' s  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time ,  signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market .  * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ?  * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based  allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic  character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points .  * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given  price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in  greater competition at the national level .  * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import .  * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links . access to international  transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for  details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets .  connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators .  even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera ' s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions :  * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission ' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach .  * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a  specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission ' s stated  preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching .  * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power .  * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation .  * * end * *  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 ! ?

2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or  self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket  market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december  31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating  capacity .  ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an  increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or  november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources .  in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc  asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 .  increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 ,  2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of  service by november 1 , 2002 .  in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on  "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted  massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206  investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of  refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said ,  appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally  disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same  actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then ,  and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded .  for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted ,  chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw  of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed  that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . ""  he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation  are generally state issues .  ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at :  citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 .  a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows :  electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way .  ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a  cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand - response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that  demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs .  interconnections  fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 .  ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action .  longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long - term regional solution .  natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior  notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems .  hydroelectric power  ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources .  comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to  handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for  modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades .  oil pipelines  ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market .  conference with state commissioners  ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west  as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western  states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 ,  2001 in boise , idaho .

""  there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of  the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,  will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it  address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just  to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?  the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter  technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are  implementing this technology .  3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas  such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what  value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of  stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to  ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .  the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual  customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful  history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute  averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the  distribution of load looks like .  i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our  concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these  topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be  reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe  in the form of a talk here at enron .  again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again  soon .  stinson  nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm  to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com  subject : stanford project  hello vince and stinson ,  first of all ,  best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !  if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together  some time to have dinner .  i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding  it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is  eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !  we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would  hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into  the "" problem / opportunity generation environment . "" that really helps the  student  to develop a realistic vision about their research .  perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter ,  say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of  course  you could visit us before that too .  with my warmest wishes ,  nick",Ham

23,"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

73,"Subject: re : ebs var transaction policy  i have two things biting me .  first is time . i need to turn a draft for hannon and rice asap . so , the  value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a v @ r policy will quickly  evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say .  second , i have a unique situation . our concept of v @ r is really unlike the  rest of enron ' s today . what happens today is that network engineers  unilaterally make decisions about deployment , configuration and other matters  which effect the longs and shorts of our asset / contract portfolio that they  view strictly from a network operating standpoint .  a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop ( three large  servers storing 165 gigabytes each ) from portland to la . the servers are  already in place and purchased , so no capital was involved . but the  decision has huge ramifications on the future la / new york and other bandwidth  usage , and that cost money . now it could be that the la / new york cost is  cheaper than the portland / new york cost , the whole point is no one knows .  what our "" value - at - risk "" policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions  and put them into the hands of the risk management group , where the decision  will be made with at least some economic work behind it .  i really see the ebs v @ r policy to be misnamed , since we don ' t really have  the math done to calc v @ r . it really is a volumetric - based control policy  that says you can ' t make network changes over xx amount of megabytes ( a  storage measure ) or oc - 3 equivalents ( a bandwidth measure ) without risk  management making or approving the decision . i do believe that with  research ' s help , we can in time actually calculate the v @ r impact of such  decisions . at that time , the policy should be modified to set metrics based  on the v @ r calculations .  so if you have an open enough mind to let us co - op your word for a minute ,  we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into  thinking about their decisions as having value effects . said directly ,  kevin hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over  significant network changes from the field to the trading floor , and i am  going to issue something now to effectuate that . . . . . .  so . . . i really want your views on what we are doing , but thought you needed  some flavor and an sense of the urgency . if you can weigh in , do so  quickly . . . . .  barry pearce  06 / 30 / 00 04 : 47 am  to : john echols / enron communications @ enron communications , lou casari / enron  communications @ enron communications  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  positive . . . .  - - - - - forwarded by barry pearce / enron communications on 06 / 30 / 00 04 : 49 am  - - - - -  ted murphy @ ect  06 / 29 / 00 11 : 33 am  to : barry pearce / enron communications @ enron communications @ enron  cc :  subject : re : ebs var transaction policy  barry ,  conceptually , i see no reason that a process like this can not be  implemented . in some way we have attempted to do so through the enron corp  transaction approval process ( tap ) . i have forwarded to john a copy of this ,  along with the risk management policy . i ' ll let him share with you if ok ( i  really don ' t want to act as the firm ' s in - house kinko ' s !

83,"Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group  the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of  power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the  market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can  act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it .  modeling details :  the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel  forward  prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then  uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model  parameters  are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts  in january or september .  using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched  or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the  start - up  cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at  minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last  two stand for )  are taken into consideration .  with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can  be generated  by this unit , then sums it up across all units .  the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16  hours to run for about  200 units .  after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make  the model more flexible ,  say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one  unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet ) .  assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology  is ok , though  it does not capture most of the optionality .  my concerns are :  whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more  details before making  any conclusion .  100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i  don ' t see how spreadsheet  can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again ,  if enron ' s buying the  model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ?  how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the  associate who initiated all  these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why  the model horizon is one year .  we can either  oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them .  or  redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going  to use the output ) . but  in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we  do it ?  as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up  delay into consideration .  it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10 , 000 simulations for  one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into  it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that  when using forward - forward vol  simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since  most of the time - cost  occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes ,  i hope the full model  ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main  task will be interfacing , i . e . ,  getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need  most help if i am to do it .  please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle  cisneros today .  p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message  below ) .  best ,  alex  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58  am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  jeff m gray  01 / 04 / 2001  to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com ,  michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com  cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com  subject : fw : project timeline  ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading  methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s  group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged  to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the  research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while  interfacing regularly with us .  1 / 4 kickoff  1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) .  1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model  ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi  and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) .  1 / 22 complete financial trader "" user "" interface , within the access  environment ( rdi ) .  1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from  rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface  ( rdi ) .  1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations  other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) .  2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) .  2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) .  2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train  users .  2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc .  jeff",Ham

96,"Subject: power trading  hi folks :  very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts :  1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part  better than me .  2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london  has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading .  3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the  authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position  limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by  commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading  operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but  day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group .  4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the  models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under  bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the  corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept .  5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help .  6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should  contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems .  australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations .  you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues  ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) .  barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there .  i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if  possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will  do it next week .  krishna .",Ham

149,"Subject: a better investment than the stock market .  all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions .  parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in  his closet !  does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .  and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -  new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old  sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .  "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old  woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my  husband earns in a year "" .  the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet .  as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of  "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday  after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom .  "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever  15 - year - old .  the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one  $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to  the top of the list .  the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and  really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .  within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .  "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i  was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over  the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,  fifties and hundreds .  "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next  bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid . the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,  section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in  the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .  every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,  "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a  five - dollar fee .  [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .  be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you  say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really  can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are  "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some  megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this  program has attained , it is currently working better  than ever .  note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .  in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the  following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money  for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .  this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total  $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" .  pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .  here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions  and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i  only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of  $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i  have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything .

 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just  that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response .  we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as  you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the  report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all  orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name  and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report .  = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always  send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write  the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  r . r .  po box 18048  chicago , il 60618  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net  order report # 2 from :  gm boland  353 jonestown rd . suite 125  winston salem , nc 27104  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  r . chernick  po box 771661  c . s . florida 33077  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . eiseman  po box 451971  sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  l . samon  po box 31  castletown  isle of man  im 99 5 xp  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks ,  continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for  report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until  you do .  + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can  relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will  continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time  your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different  report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which  report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate  more income send another batch of e - mails and start  the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you  can generate from this business !

"" that ' s why i ' m sitting up  here and you are all sitting out there ! ""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer .

 to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders !

( note : no overlap ) . this  results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios ( approximately 247 trading  days per  year ) .  example :  if the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this :  19980801 6 . 5 6 . 6 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 2  19980802 6 . 3 6 . 3 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9  19980803 6 . 6 6 . 8 6 . 9 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1  then the change from 8 / 1 / 98 to 8 / 2 / 98 is :  6 . 3 / 6 . 5 6 . 3 / 6 . 6 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 / 7 . 1  and the change from 8 / 2 / 98 to 8 / 3 / 98 is :  6 . 6 / 6 . 3 6 . 8 / 6 . 3 6 . 9 / 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 / 6 . 9  2 ) randomly select 62 of these "" ratio "" vectors ( approx . 62 trading days in a  quarter ) .  3 ) multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ( ie , the 62  6 mo ratios are multiplied together , the 62 lyr ratios are multiplied  togeter , etc . ) . the result represents a single quarterly yield curve  transformation . apply it to "" today ' s "" yield curve . the resulting yield  curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates  4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are  generated , say 100 .  5 ) proceed with testing process .  i would be interested in your comments .  leslie abreo  andrew kalotay associates , inc .  61 broadway , ste 3025  new york ny 10006  phone : ( 212 ) 482 0900  fax : ( 212 ) 482 0529  email : leslie . abreo @ kalotay . com  visit aka ' s website at http : / / www . kalotay . com  - fasl 33 article . pdf",Ham

( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",Ham

268,"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables , such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000 makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars , without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs , insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables , marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars . for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items , and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders . typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period ) reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short - and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses , income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",Ham

"" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added .",Ham

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",Ham

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"" you must never try to send any command to that address , as it  would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands  must be sent to the "" listserv address , "" listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it  is very important to understand the difference between the two , but  fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax  number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a  normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and  dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you  will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no  harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your  fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be  inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the  fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the  voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does  not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number .  people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with  mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or  thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a  lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list  address .  you may leave the list at any time by sending a "" signoff frbnyrmagl ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how  you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if  you do not trust the system , send a "" set frbnyrmagl repro "" command and  listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see  that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way .  after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if  your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it  informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a "" set  frbnyrmagl ack norepro "" command , listserv will mail you a short  acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox  directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is  an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off  acknowledgements completely with "" set frbnyrmagl noack norepro "" .  contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a  list of the available archive files by sending an "" index frbnyrmagl ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files  with a "" get frbnyrmagl logxxxx "" command , or using listserv ' s database  search facilities . send an "" info database "" command for more information  on the latter .  important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its  existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to  third parties . please note that the "" give "" command is automatically  disabled for all archive files .  more information on listserv commands can be found in the listserv  reference card , which you can retrieve by sending an "" info refcard ""  command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com .",Ham

392,"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack  of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans  and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is  reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and  democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the  bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into  the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place .  additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term  power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the  bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of  contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8  billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the  details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab  31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill  passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen ,  currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature ,  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated  that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally ,  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion  authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the  governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb  6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for  the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according  to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has  signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond  issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan )  stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers ,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the  state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and  passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",Ham

"" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",Ham

455,"Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera  insight  title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184  overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas  directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor  , s point of view .  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november .  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the  results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas  directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road  map to guide them .  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following :  * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all  candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although  issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved .  * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the  commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to  single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal  markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive  provides for !  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

508,"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",Ham

525,"Subject: ees operational risk  per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes  that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking  for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .  briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the  deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set  is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .  if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s  business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the  scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of  ees operational risk .  briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their  profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is  assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,  then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence  a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that  rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is  quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .  if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""  excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .  another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough  understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment  ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement  type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is  indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement .  if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it  systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel  workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks .  finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .  he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t  think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .  - kevin k .  ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will  know more .",Ham

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",Ham

611,"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01  please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

659,"Subject: energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege )  shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",Ham

676,"Subject: re :  dear navroz  thanks for getting back to me . the reason there has been a dialogue ( not , i  should point out , with nick , but with shan millie ) , is that my work is of  quite a large size , and needs to find an appropriate home . the question is  should it go into a compilation book , or somehow be published in the  magazine ? i was awaiting some feedback from risk on the best course of  action .  we were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine , and a full  version in risk ' s upcoming "" game choices "" book , but i ' ve heard nothing from  your organisation until now ( and i fear we ' ve now missed the boat on the game  choices book deadline ) . i ' m attaching the full internal enron document for  your reference , and i ' d appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the  article in your journal . since the subject is highly diagrammatic , i ' m  concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams ! ( it is  currently only 6000 words , but is around 25 a 4 pages long . ) if you can give  me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the  text , i ' ll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred  format .  shan millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity  in my writing , but incorporating these would actually make the article longer  rather than shorter . i think you ' d better look the document over before i do  further work on it .  i look forward to your response .  many thanks ,  steve leppard  enron capital & trade resources corp .  from : "" navroz patel ""  04 / 28 / 2000 03 : 25 pm  please respond to "" navroz patel ""  to :  cc :  subject :  dear steven ,  my name is navroz patel and i am the technical assistant at risk magazine . i  am contacting you with regards to your initial dialogue with nick dunbar .  we would be grateful if you could email to both of the addresses below a  copy of your ' real options ' article for our consideration .  please note that articles must have full references , be approximately 4000  words in length , and the attachment should be in ms word or pdf format .  npatel @ risk . co . uk  ndunbar @ risk . co . uk  ?  thank you for your interest .  yours sincerely ,  navroz patel .  technical assistant , risk magazine .",Ham

 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business !

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",Ham

""  2 . a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us  yesterday that "" there was little that the federal government could do  specifically to help , beyond focusing on national issues ( increased  production , transmission capacity etc . ) . ""  of course , the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with  respect to intervention than the energy team , as was true with the clinton  administration . yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from  the official bush view at this stage . further guidance should be forthcoming  with respect to this issue from energy secretary - designate spence abraham ' s  testimony tomorrow .",Ham

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

902,"Subject: marketpoint license agreement  john / vince :  i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross  section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .  as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for  marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your  consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire  bundled product , which includes  ? north american gas , short and long term  ? north american electricity , short and long term  ? world gas  ? western european gas  ? world oil  we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european  gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into  marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of  months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are  presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an  attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout  your worldwide business .  as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will  want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at  the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately  the fully  bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the  software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the  electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas  model plus the data for  the software license plus the data license for a  total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under  the fully bundled price . i  think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from  marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward  together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another  model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you  up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas  decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc",Ham
